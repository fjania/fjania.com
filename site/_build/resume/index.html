    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <article>
      I find my greatest professional joy when I am designing, developing and inventing new technologies that are meant to enrich the lives of the people that use them. The subject areas I am most fond of are: collaboration and social software, novel and transparent user interfaces, and information visualization. I am a compassionate manager and leader, a sincere teammate who thrives in an environment of smart and creative people that regularly challenge each other, and a prolific inventor with over 70 patents pending.

        <p class='job-summary'>Lead software engineering and write all of the non-app code for readtapestry.com and gifyourself.in.</p>
        <ul class='job-bullets'>
          <li>Develop and maintain all of the backend code and infrastructure for readtapestry.com. This includes the Python/Django based web application, Redis/Celery task queue, Postgresql DB, and integrations with 3rd party email, messaging, storage services.</li>
          <li>Develop and maintain the API used by the Tapestry iOS and Android engineers. The API provides the JSON interface to all of aspects of the web application for consumption by the devices.</li>
          <li>Develop and maintain all HTML/CSS/Javascript for readtapestry.com. This includes code responsible basic site layout and the far more complex code which comprises the several story editors available to users.</li>
          <li>Develop and maintain all backend code and infrastructure for gifyourself.in. This includes Python/Django, Redis/Celery, Postgresql. The site sustained &gt; 300 concurrent users over the period of ~10 hours after launch without any degradation in performance or outage through effective use of asynchronous task management for long-running gif generation.</li>
          <li>Develop and maintain most front-end code for gifyourself.in. I write the bulk of the site’s functionality which includes (1) tooling for users to put their face over gifs by capturing, cropping and editing input from the user’s webcam and (2) tooling for administrators to define where on each frame in the gif the user’s face should appear. This is accomplished using plain Javascript, JQuery, and the HTML5 Media interface.</li>
          <li>Provide access to statistics data, through a variety of platforms, to our business team for both sites. This includes both web GUIs and access to ETL’d data in a single relational DB via SQL.</li>

          <li>Conceived of and implemented "staff mode" for the site. This function allows staff members to toggle their view of the site to either emulate a user's view, user mode, or enter staff mode where all elements on the site have staff controls added for promoting content or acting on spam quickly.</li>
          <li>Wrote and manage releases of the findings Chrome extension - a tool that highlights text on a web page which has been collected to the findings service.</li>
          <li>Wrote the service's bookmarklet in native javascript. The bookmarklet allows people to clip text from a web page, customize it's theme and optionally share it to twitter or facebook.</li>
          <li>Wrote a tool for scraping the Amazon Kindle Highlights page to work around the fact that Amazon does not provide an API for highlights.</li>
          <li>Develped a page for site administrators that shows a breakdown of various statistics related to site activity.</li>
          <li>Wrote the backend for the user activity stream. The previous implementation was restricted to a static list of possible acitivites. My rewrite made it dynamic allowing for additional types of activity to be added in the future.</li>

The researches had purchased a "force plate" which measures the force applied as a patient walks on it in order to analyze gait pathology and athletic performance. Using the Win32 API and OpenGL I wrote software which read the stream of data from the force plate and a video feed. The software displayed a synchronized side by side view of the force plate's data (displayed as a 3-D visualization of the direction and magnitude of the force applied to the plate) and video of the human subject being measured.</p>
