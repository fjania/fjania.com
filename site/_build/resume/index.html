    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <article>
      I find my greatest professional joy when I am building new technologies that help people make sense of the world and express themselves. The subject areas I am most fond of are collaboration, messaging, social tools, data visualization, music, and fitness. I am a compassionate manager and leader, a sincere teammate who thrives in an environment of smart and creative people that regularly challenge each other, and a prolific inventor.

        <p class='education-thesis'>Thesis: Applying Visual Analysis to Ground Force Reaction Data in the Study of Gait Pathology</p>
        <p class='education-description'>Completed a master's thesis project based on a request by researchers at Lenox Hill Hospital. The researches had purchased a "force plate" which measures the force applied as a patient walks on it in order to analyze gait pathology and athletic performance. Using the Win32 API and OpenGL I wrote software which read the stream of data from the force plate and a video feed. The software displayed a synchronized side by side view of the force plate's data (displayed as a 3-D visualization of the direction and magnitude of the force applied to the plate) and video of the human subject being measured.</p>
