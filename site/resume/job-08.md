title: Software Engineer
company: Findings.com (a Betaworks company) - New York City, NY
dates: (07/2012 - 01/2013)
summary: One of two software engineers working on the full stack of findings.com, primilary responsible for the product's front-end. Findings is a service which allows people to clip, collect and share text snippets from the web.
bullets:
- Wrote all of the site's JavaScript using a combination of native JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI, and D3. Also wrote a portion of the site's backend, in Python/Django, particularly the endpoints needed for all of the ajax calls on the site.
- Conceived of and implemented "staff mode" for the site. This function allows staff members to toggle their view of the site to either emulate a user's view, user mode, or enter staff mode where all elements on the site have staff controls added for promoting content or acting on spam quickly.
- Wrote and manage releases of the findings Chrome extension - a tool that highlights text on a web page which has been collected to the findings service.
- Wrote the service's bookmarklet in native javascript. The bookmarklet allows people to clip text from a web page, customize it's theme and optionally share it to twitter or facebook.
- Wrote a tool for scraping the Amazon Kindle Highlights page to work around the fact that Amazon does not provide an API for highlights.
- Develped a page for site administrators that shows a breakdown of various statistics related to site activity.
- Wrote the backend for the user activity stream. The previous implementation was restricted to a static list of possible acitivites. My rewrite made it dynamic allowing for additional types of activity to be added in the future.
