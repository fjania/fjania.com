title: Software Engineer; Team Lead
company: Google - New York City, NY
dates: (06/2010 - 07/2012)
summary: Software engineer and team lead for a display ad management software product. Still working past the acquisition as a startup would, so I wear many hats in this role.
bullets:
- Took over and streamlined the release process for the product. Implemented a release strategy and wrote release code that allowed minor releases to happen without system downtime.
- Wrote a custom task queue management system based on MongoDB for offloading long-running tasks from the web server process.
- Managed the infrastructure for the front and back end of the product, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, memcached, Nginx, Django/Python/uWSGI and Java/Jetty based application servers.
- Built a system, based on Django/Chronograph, for doing server and system health monitoring and alerting.
- Built a system status console application to display server and system health to augment monitoring and help identify early problems.
- Architected a system for doing real-time and batch alerting for customer concerns about their ad campaigns.
- In the absence of a dedicated UX designer, I step into make decisions-based-on-experience when product teams and engineers reached an impasse on the details of implementing a feature.
- Implemented a variety of code and infrastructure updates to improve application speed and performance.
- In addition to my day-to-day work on the core display ad management product I am also working on a javascript based word cloud generator. A demo cloud and the project source are available.
