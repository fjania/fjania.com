title: VP Engineering
company: Tapestry/GifYourselfIn (a Betaworks company) - New York City, NY (01/2013 - 04/2014)
summary: Lead software engineering and write all of the non-app code for readtapestry.com and gifyourself.in.
bullets:
    - Develop and maintain all of the backend code and infrastructure for readtapestry.com. This includes the Python/Django based web application, Redis/Celery task queue, Postgresql DB, and integrations with 3rd party email, messaging, storage services.
    - Develop and maintain the API used by the Tapestry iOS and Android engineers. The API provides the JSON interface to all of aspects of the web application for consumption by the devices.
    - Develop and maintain all HTML/CSS/Javascript for readtapestry.com. This includes code responsible basic site layout and the far more complex code which comprises the several story editors available to users.
    - Develop and maintain all backend code and infrastructure for gifyourself.in. This includes Python/Django, Redis/Celery, Postgresql. The site sustained &gt; 300 concurrent users over the period of ~10 hours after launch without any degradation in performance or outage through effective use of asynchronous task management for long-running gif generation.
    - Develop and maintain most front-end code for gifyourself.in. I write the bulk of the site’s functionality which includes (1) tooling for users to put their face over gifs by capturing, cropping and editing input from the user’s webcam and (2) tooling for administrators to define where on each frame in the gif the user’s face should appear. This is accomplished using plain Javascript, JQuery, and the HTML5 Media interface.
    - Provide access to statistics data, through a variety of platforms, to our business team for both sites. This includes both web GUIs and access to ETL’d data in a single relational DB via SQL.
    - Provide leadership and mentoring to junior and peer staff both within Tapestry and to other Betaworks companies.
